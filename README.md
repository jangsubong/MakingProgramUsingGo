### Question
Hello, professor. In the ScanDir function, how do I add an additional Modir() value to the namesizeFiles variable without modification?
File name is "Files_Remove.go"
 * I solved it! Thank you // A separate slice of "time.Time" type could be declared and added by saving the values of info.ModTime.
